This is a project I have done for Extraction, Transformation and Loading course of my master in Data Science in CUNEF.

Repoository consist of database file, script in R and instructions of the assignment in Spanish. 

In database we have 3 tables, listings, hoods and reviews. The objective of the assignment is clean and agregating data in 2 cleaner tables to check availability of the accomodations in Madrid according to price and review points.


I have done this in R but this can be done also in Python. For R you need to pre-install dbplyr, tidyverse and RSQLite to R Studio.

You can contribute or comment to this project. Data is public. However, I don't take responsibility for the use out of terms and conditions stated by Airbnb.
